	"description": "WIP Proto graveminds are the last seen evolution of wraiths, evolving from apostles these entities have had their bodies completly overtaken by sculk. Their body mass is now 100% sculk, and due to this, they inherit the power to manipulate sculk to things never before seen. These are high-priority targets, as if they should ever evolve into a gravemind, the end is nigh.",
